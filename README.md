# Boolean Logic Demonstrator

An interactive web application that helps users understand boolean logic operations through visual demonstrations.

## Features

- Interactive switches to toggle true/false values
- Visual lightbulb that responds to logical operations
- Eight different logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, NOT A, NOT B)
- Live truth table with highlighted current state
- Interactive circuit diagram that visualizes the current operation
- Code examples in JavaScript, Python, C++, and Java with syntax highlighting
- Detailed operation descriptions and contextual explanations
- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Dark mode support
- Persistent settings using localStorage

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser. No installation or build process required.

### Operation Options

The application supports these boolean operations:

- AND: True only when both inputs are True
- OR: True when at least one input is True
- XOR: True when inputs are different
- NAND: False only when both inputs are True
- NOR: True only when both inputs are False
- XNOR: True when both inputs are the same
- NOT A: Inverts the value of input A
- NOT B: Inverts the value of input B
